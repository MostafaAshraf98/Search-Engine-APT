id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Direct-to-consumer companies generate<\/span> a wealth of raw transactional data that needs to be refined into metrics and dimensions that founders and operators can interpret on a dashboard.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re the founder of an e-commerce startup, there\u2019s a pretty good chance you\u2019re using a platform like Shopify, BigCommerce or WooCommerce, and one of the dozens of analytics extensions like RetentionX, Sensai metrics or ProfitWell that provide off-the-shelf reporting.<\/p>\n<p>At a high level, these tools are excellent for helping you understand what\u2019s happening in your business. But in our experience, we&#8217;ve learned that you\u2019ll inevitably find yourself asking questions that your off-the-shelf extensions simply can\u2019t answer.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tWe\u2019re generally big fans of plug-and-play business intelligence tools, but they won\u2019t scale with your business. Don\u2019t rely on them after you\u2019ve outgrown them.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Here are a couple of common problems that you or your data team may encounter with off-the-shelf dashboards:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Charts are typically based on a few standard dimensions and don\u2019t provide enough flexibility to examine a certain segment from different angles to fully understand them.<\/li>\n<li>Dashboards have calculation errors that are impossible to fix. It\u2019s not uncommon for such dashboards to report the pre-discounted retail amount for orders in which a customer used a promo code at checkout. In the worst cases, this can lead founders to drastically overestimate their customer lifetime value (LTV) and overspend on marketing campaigns.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Even when founders are fully aware of the shortcomings of their data, they can find it difficult to take decisive action with confidence.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re generally big fans of plug-and-play business intelligence tools, but they won\u2019t scale with your business. Don\u2019t rely on them after you\u2019ve outgrown them.<\/p>\n<h2>Evolving your startup\u2019s data strategy<\/h2>\n<p>Building a data stack costs much less than it did a decade ago. As a result, many businesses are building one and harnessing the compounding value of these insights earlier in their journey.<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s no trivial task. For early-stage founders, the opportunity cost of any big project is immense. Many early-stage companies find themselves in an uncomfortable situation \u2014 they feel paralyzed by a lack of high-fidelity data. They need better business intelligence (BI) to become data driven, but they don\u2019t have the resources to manage and execute the project.<\/p>\n<p>This leaves founders with a few options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hire a seasoned data leader.<\/li>\n<li>Hire a junior data professional and supplement them with experienced consultants.<\/li>\n<li>Hire and manage experienced consultants directly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All of these options have merits and drawbacks, and any of them can be executed well or poorly. Many companies delay building a data warehouse because of the cost of getting it right &#8212; or the fear of messing it up. Both are valid concerns!<\/p>\n<h2>Start by identifying your critical metrics<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019re generally big fans of plug-and-play business intelligence tools, but they won\u2019t scale with your business.

One of E Ink\u2019s biggest selling points is power saving. It\u2019s a key part of the reason your Kindle\u2019s battery life is rated in weeks, instead of hours. But the technology has traditionally had numerous drawbacks that have hampered mainstream adoption outside of a few select categories like e-readers.<\/p>\n<p>Recent generations of E Ink\u2019s electronic paper have added color and sped up the notoriously slow refresh rate and responsiveness. One imagines that there\u2019s still a ways to go before Apple adopts such technology, even for a secondary, external display. Though, with the first of the company\u2019s foldables rumored for a 2025 release (at earliest), perhaps that leaves enough time for the electronic paper technology to get up to speed.<\/p>\n<p>As ever, one must take all of the above with a few grains of salt. It\u2019s a long timeline, and even if the reports prove out, there\u2019s a big gulf between testing and releasing.

permission to become a bank in a major setback to Flipkart billionaire Sachin Bansal, who has been looking to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/12\/navi-ipo-sachin-bansal\/\">take his newer venture, Navi, public<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The Reserve Bank of India on Tuesday rejected four applications including Bansal\u2019s Chaitanya (the micro financing unit of Navi Technologies), saying they were \u201cnot found suitable\u201d for running full-fledged banks in the world\u2019s second-most populated market.<\/p>\n<p>Tuesday&#8217;s decision is a major blow to Bansal, who has been seeking a banking license for years. A license would have created a pathway for Bansal\u2019s firm, which offers customers insurance and loan products, to improve its financials and launch additional products.<\/p>\n<p>A full-fledged banking license in India would have allowed Navi to accept customer deposits and then use those funds to lend to others. (Else, firms have to look at other banks and funding sources, where it costs them more interest to borrow money.) A license would have also enabled Navi to settle international transactions and launch its own credit cards, a fintech executive who wished to be anonymous explained.<\/p>\n<p>Bansal, who was at a separate presser during this announcement, said Navi will analyze the central bank\u2019s decision and evaluate options. Bansal, who co-founded Flipkart, left the e-commerce giant in 2018 and founded Navi in the same year. He has marketed Navi as a financial company that happens to understand tech.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe will ask [the] RBI the reason behind this decision. There could be an appeal from us against this decision,\u201d he said, adding that the decision was \u201cnot the end of road\u201d for the startup.<\/p>\n<p>Navi, which filed for a $440 million IPO earlier this year, applied for a banking license in early 2020. The startup attempted to put together a funding round at over $4 billion valuation earlier and engaged with a number of investors including SoftBank, but the talks fell following its inability to secure the license, TechCrunch reported earlier.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Local media reports in recent quarters have stated that Navi has been alleged to violate foreign exchange rules, struggled to maintain proper governance within the firm and has not responsibly handled customers&#8217; personal and sensitive data.<\/p>\n<p>The other three firms that did not make the RBI\u2019s cut for universal bank license are UAE Exchange, the Repatriates Cooperative Finance and Development Bank, and a proposal by former Citibank executive Pankaj Vaish.

But it now offers a general purpose serverless platform that you can configure through a simple &#8220;git push&#8221; command or by using Docker containers.<\/p>\n<p>The company\u2019s serverless platform is now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.koyeb.com\/blog\/koyeb-serverless-platform-public-preview\">available as a public preview<\/a> with a free tier to get started and try out the service \u2014 the free tier lets you run two nano apps on the platform. It has already been tested by 10,000 developers during the private beta phase. There are currently 3,000 applications running on Koyeb\u2019s infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>Koyeb wants to abstract your server infrastructure as much as possible so that you can focus on development instead of system administration. You can use it to host a web app, an API or event-driven workloads.<\/p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, the startup doesn\u2019t use Kubernetes. Instead, it has built its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.koyeb.com\/blog\/the-koyeb-serverless-engine-from-kubernetes-to-nomad-firecracker-and-kuma\">own custom stack<\/a> based on Firecracker microVMs, Nomad and Kuma. It runs on bare-metal servers with recent Intel and AMD chips.<\/p>\n<p>There are two ways to deploy your apps to Koyeb. You can deploy from your git repository (currently limited to GitHub repositories) or from any public or private container registry. Koyeb has a web interface but also offers a command-line interface and an API.<\/p>\n<p>When you deploy a new app, Koyeb gives your app a &#8220;.koyeb.app&#8221; subdomain and automatically secures the app with TLS. You can also configure your own domain name.<\/p>\n<p>If you need more resources, you can easily scale your app from a slider. In that case, Koyeb launches your app on several new instances and traffic is automatically load balanced between those instances.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>All of this is transparent for the development team. Every time there\u2019s a new git commit, Koyeb automatically starts building and deploying your app.<\/p>\n<p>Koyeb plans to offer a global edge network. The service is currently live in one core location in Paris and 250 edge locations for native load balancing, TLS encryption and CDN-like caching. By the end of the year, your app will be simultaneously deployed to 10 core locations around the world.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s clear that Koyeb is still a work in progress. But it sounds like a promising start for lean development teams who don\u2019t want to spend too much time on managing a cloud infrastructure.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Koyeb has evolved quite a lot since I first covered the startup.
