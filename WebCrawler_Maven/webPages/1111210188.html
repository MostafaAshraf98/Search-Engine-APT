       <h2>About our trusted partner</h2>
       <p>Firefox Private Network browser protection uses a server provided by our partner <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/mozilla/firefox-private-network-privacy-notice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare</a>, who collects a limited amount of data and deletes it permanently after 24 hours.</p>

         <h5>How does Firefox Private Network browser extension work?</h5>
         <p>The Firefox Private Network browser extension creates an encrypted tunnel called a proxy between your browser and a network managed by our trusted partner Cloudflare. While you browse the web, your browsing data flows from Firefox directly through this secure connection. This means that your ISP, network manager, or eavesdroppers on a public Wi-Fi network cannot see your browsing. Since your web traffic is proxied by Cloudflare before it reaches the web, your location and IP address are also masked so that online trackers have a harder time following you as you browse.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
         <h5>Why do I have to pay for the Firefox Private Network browser extension?</h5>
         <p>There is always a cost associated with the network infrastructure required to run a secure proxy service like the Firefox Private Network browser extension. We believe the simplest and most transparent way to account for these costs is by providing this service at a modest subscription fee.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
         <h5>Does Firefox Private Network work on all browsers?</h5>
         <p>The free extension requires the Firefox browser for desktop, which is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p>
        </div>
       </div>
       <div class="faq-column">
        <div class="faq-item">
         <h5>Is this a VPN?</h5>
         <p>No. The Firefox Private Network browser extension offers set and forget network protection while you shop, bank, and browse in Firefox. It’s lightweight and simple. A VPN is a more robust software application that allows location switching. It’s a separate app you install to secure everything on your device that connects to the internet, including all browsers, social media apps, and banking apps. <a href="https://vpn.mozilla.org">Learn more</a> if you’re interested in our VPN.</p>

         <h5>When will Firefox Private Network be available outside the US?</h5>
         <p>We will offer the Firefox Private Network beta in the United States into early 2020. We’re working on expanding the service to other regions soon after.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
         <h5>Does Firefox Private Network log my browsing history?</h5>
         <p>Firefox is committed to protecting your privacy. Our <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox-private-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy policy</a> outlines how we handle your data. The browser-level protection, provided by Cloudflare, temporarily logs unidentified browsing history and deletes this data within 24 hours as a mechanism to detect and handle abuse on the network. Neither Firefox nor Cloudflare is able to associate usage with users as each party holds partial aspects of this data which are never joined.</p>
