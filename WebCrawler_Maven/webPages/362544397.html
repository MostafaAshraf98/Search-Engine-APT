Not long after, these changes reverberated through the massive weather systems that dominate much of Asia &ndash; the monsoons.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe changes to the monsoons were an unexpected side effect of the lockdowns that restricted human activity. With no vehicles plying the streets and with industrial activity slowing considerably, the reduced emissions led to a significant decrease in atmospheric aerosols. These are tiny solid and liquid droplets suspended in the atmosphere, and they include microscopic particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5) harmful to human health. Aerosols include sulphur dioxide, from burning coal, and black carbon or soot. The latter is a byproduct of agricultural burning, which in India is often from wood fires commonly used in cooking.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have long known \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.researchgate.net\u002Fpublication\u002F261324159_INFLUENCE_OF_ATMOSPHERIC_AEROSOLS_ON_HEALTH_AND_ENVIRONMENT-CLIMATE_CHANGE\"\u003Ethe ill-effects of aerosols\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

Winds blow from high pressure to low pressure areas, driving moisture-laden winds from ocean to land. When the land warms up faster &ndash; as it did without its usual aerosol shade &ndash; the monsoon rains are stronger, and that's what researchers observed when the aerosol layer thinned.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\"We observed that it increased annual monsoon rainfall by \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fiopscience.iop.org\u002Farticle\u002F10.1088\u002F1748-9326\u002Fac109c\"\u003Eas much as 5-15%, around 3mm a day\u003C\u002Fa\u003E,\" says Fadnavis.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo put this in context, the increase in monsoon rainfall was the equivalent of an hour's moderate shower of rain per day\u003Cstrong\u003E.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E In drought-prone India, highly dependent on seasonal monsoon rainfall for its agriculture, economy, food security and overall health, this is significant, she says.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20220517-the-uncertain-fate-of-asias-monsoons-0"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":["p0c7b23f"],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20220517-the-uncertain-fate-of-asias-monsoons-1"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EBut the impact wasn't just observed in India.

The lingual frenulum is a strip of tissue extending from the back of the mouth to the midline of the tongue. If this tissue is restrictive, the tip of the tongue can't extend beyond the lips, the tongue-tie can be quite evident.

Advice on the right breastfeeding technique, massaging the frenulum, and exercising the tongue can all help resolve such mild cases, in his view.

PFAS chemicals bind to serum proteins in the blood, and researchers found that PFAS levels in the bloodstream of those donating were significantly reduced.

We got this figure using a test story, calculating emissions as above and then dividing that by the pageviews that the test story actually had over six months. That gives us a better estimate than just plugging in the URL from a story to the agency&rsquo;s standard carbon calculator, because for a story where the number of pageviews is a weighty factor in the equation, using data on actual pageviews makes it more accurate.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe story we used as a test to get this figure was a BBC Future story, and we used the actual number of pageviews it had over a six-month period. Factors such as how many images a page has and the length of the story can make a big difference in the energy required to load the page, and how long the reader spends on the page.

The carbon intensity of the energy grid varies between countries. The calculation assumed the average intensity as reported by the International Energy Agency (475g CO2-equivalent per kWh). But in reality, this will vary based on where readers are in the world.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFuture Planet does not reside on any single server, and the BBC has servers in multiple datacentres. The BBC also uses Content Delivery Networks, third-party networks of servers that reduce the load on our own. The calculation doesn&rsquo;t take account of this, which slightly inflates the estimate as CDNs are more efficient.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe cumulative uncertainty from these factors is the reason we show the digital component of emissions as a range, rather than a single figure.

Similarly, we can&rsquo;t yet measure for a given click exactly how much carbon is released from the transfer of that exact data over the internet, the energy to run those specific servers at any instant, or which type of device a reader is using when they make that click.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are other factors that some might argue should be counted in a story&rsquo;s carbon emissions, too. What about the BBC staff who work on Future Planet, some full-time but many sporadically among other obligations &ndash; do we count, for example, the energy used to heat and power the office? If we do, should we count the carbon emissions from the large number of energy-hungry servers housed in the building, or is that irrelevant as they don&rsquo;t host Future Planet? Or you could take it even further: if a journalist ate a sandwich while on location reporting for us, do we count the carbon footprint of the food &ndash; or not, since they&rsquo;d likely have to eat regardless of whether they were on assignment?
