         <h1 class="title text-blue">Community Code of Conduct</h1> 
         <p> The Pylons Project developers work their hardest to adhere to a common community code of conduct based heavily on the <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct">Ubuntu Code of Conduct</a>. We would greatly appreciate it if everyone contributing and interacting with projects under the Pylons Project would also follow this Code of Conduct. </p> <span id="be-considerate"></span> 
         <h3>Be considerate.</h3> 
         <p> Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and we expect you to take those consequences into account when making decisions. For example, when we are in a feature freeze, please don't upload dramatically new versions of critical system software, as other people will be testing the frozen system and will not be expecting big changes. </p> <span id="be-respectful"></span> 
         <h3>Be respectful.</h3> 
         <p> The Pylons Project community and its members treat one another with respect. Everyone can make a valuable contribution to the Pylons Project. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We expect members of the Pylons Project community to be respectful when dealing with other contributors as well as with people outside the Pylons Project and with users of its software. </p> <span id="be-collaborative"></span> 
         <h3>Be collaborative.</h3> 
         <p> The Pylons Project and Free Software are about collaboration and working together. Collaboration reduces redundancy of work done in the Free Software world, and improves the quality of the software produced. You should aim to collaborate with other Pylons Project maintainers, as well as with the upstream community that is interested in the work you do. Your work should be done transparently, and patches to Pylons Project software should be given back to the community when they are made, not just when the distribution releases. If you wish to work on new code for existing upstream projects, at least keep those projects informed of your ideas and progress. It may not be possible to get consensus from upstream or even from your colleagues about the correct implementation of an idea, so don't feel obliged to have that agreement before you begin, but at least keep the outside world informed of your work, and publish your work in a way that allows outsiders to test, discuss, and contribute to your efforts. </p> <span id="when-you-disagree"></span> 
         <h3>When you disagree,</h3> 
         <p> …consult others. Disagreements, both political and technical, happen all the time and the Pylons Project community is no exception. The important goal is not to avoid disagreements or differing views but to resolve them constructively. You should turn to the community and to the community process to seek advice and to resolve disagreements. There are several Project Teams and Team Leaders, who may be able to help you figure out which direction will be most acceptable. If you really want to go a different way, then we encourage you to make a derivative distribution or alternative set of packages that still build on the work we've done to utilize as common of a core as possible. </p> <span id="when-you-are-unsure"></span> 
         <h3>When you are unsure,</h3> 
         <p> …ask for help. Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect in the Pylons Project community (except of course the BDFL). Asking questions avoids many problems down the road, and so questions are encouraged. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful. However, when asking a question, care must be taken to do so in an appropriate forum. Off-topic questions, such as requests for help on a development mailing list, detract from productive discussion. </p> <span id="step-down-considerately"></span> 
         <h3>Step down considerately.</h3> 
         <p> Developers on every project come and go, and the Pylons Project is no different. When you leave or disengage from the project, in whole or in part, we ask that you do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means you should tell people you are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where you leave off. </p>
