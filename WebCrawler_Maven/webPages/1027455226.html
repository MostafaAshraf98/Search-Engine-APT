                  <p>BBC Travel tells awe-inspiring, immersive travel stories to curious, passionate readers who want to learn about the world as much as they want to travel there. We are fuelled by new, unexpected and emotionally engaging stories from a global community of editors, writers, photographers and video journalists who provide a trusted perspective on the world of travel. We are independent, impartial and honest.</p> 
                  <p>In a complex world of negative news and xenophobia at one extreme, and top 10 lists and substance-less roundups at the other, we’ve lost the experience and sheer joy of travel. BBC Travel aims to provide an antidote by celebrating the people, places and cultures that make this world so wonderfully diverse and amazing.</p> 
                  <p>To do this, we tell stories with unexpected angles – on themes such as <a href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/columns/culture-identity" target="_blank"><em>culture</em></a>, <a href="http://bbc.com/travel/columns/food-hospitality" target="_blank"><em>food</em></a><em>, </em><a href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/columns/discovery" target="_blank"><em>discovery</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/columns/adventure-experience" target="_blank"><em>adventure</em></a>&nbsp;– that haven’t been covered before. Not only do we teach our readers something new, we change their perceptions about places and people. Through our travel stories, we connect readers to cultures around the world, and appeal to people who aren’t travelling at the moment as much as those who are. We encourage responsible travel and tell stories with cultural sensitivity and sustainability in mind, from diverse perspectives.</p> 
                  <p>We've received nominations and awards in the Webby Awards, Telly Awards, Lovie Awards, SATW Foundation Lowell Thomas Travel Journalism Competition, British Guild of Travel Writers Members' Excellence Awards, Australian Society of Travel Writers awards, Travel Media Awards and the Global Travel Media Alliance awards.</p>

Instead, master builders would start with a stone foundation, often some 2m deep, upon which mud bricks were laid in a running bond, meaning one brick is overlapped by two above.

European colonists named the stone circle Majorville Medicine Wheel, after the Majorville post office and general store that was once nearby.

Located on England's Salisbury Plain, Stonehenge is thousands of kilometres and an ocean apart from Iniskim Umaapi.

Where once there were hundreds of acres of bogs and marshes around Manchester, there's largely now a uniform patchwork of agricultural fields. It may look bucolic, but the loss of biodiversity that came with the draining of the mosses was colossal. Lowland peatlands have acidic, wet soil that's deficient in nutrients, but that's not to say they're sterile. A host of specialised plants and insects can thrive in these conditions and, where plants and insects abound, other wildlife does too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\"Plants are the fundamental basis of all life on Earth,\" Styles said. \"We lose them at our peril.

Lured to settle on the leaves, an insect would find itself stuck, unable to fly away from the vegetable glue that entrapped it. The sundews' leaves slowly curl around their unfortunate prey, releasing enzymes that dissolve the insect, releasing the nutrients within.

He grew them for years, conducting experiments involving them and a succession of unfortunate insects. In 1860, he wrote, \"At the present moment, I care more about \u003Cem\u003EDrosera \u003C\u002Fem\u003E[sundews] than the origin of all the species in the world\", a bold statement coming from the author of the seminal On the Origin of Species.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the story of the sundews, and other carnivorous plants besides that shared the damp surroundings of their north-westerly home, begins some 10,000 years before they caught Darwin's eye, at the time when the bogs of north-west England began to form. On the surface of those early mosses, a tapestry of sphagnum moss and other acid-loving plants abounded and, year by year, added just a little bit more fallen organic matter to the heavy black mass of saturated peat upon which they grew &ndash; an incremental accretion of plant material that, thanks to the wet and acidic ground conditions, didn't rot, and instead compressed to form peat, locking millennia of carbon safely in the ground. Peat bogs cover just 3% of the Earth's surface, but they store more carbon than all the planet's forests combined.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYet what took millennia to form was the work of short decades to undo. As Manchester grew as a city, drainage channels cut by man began to bisect the mosses, slowly but surely drying the elevated peat around them. Peat was extracted and sent into Manchester and, in return, Manchester's inhabitants fertilised the drying, nutrient-poor soil. By the 1880s, the city was producing 200,000 tons of refuse annually, 75% of which was coyly known as \"night soil\". Much of this was transported into the mosses and spread as fertiliser on what was perceived to be an unproductive wasteland. In time, much of the former peat bog became fertile, workable agricultural land.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPeat extraction, for fuel and compost, continued there well into the 20th Century, by which time 98% of the Manchester mosses had been destroyed.
