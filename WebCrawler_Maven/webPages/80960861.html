It's also one of the religion's greatest sources of myth and mystery. Yet despite the Grail's fame, no one is entirely sure where it is or whether it ever existed. However, in Spain, Valencia Cathedral believes it has the real thing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\"I always say [the evidence] is like twigs from a tree,\" said Jos&eacute; Verdeguer, Valencia Cathedral's Historical-Artistic Heritage Curator. \"If you only have one stick, it breaks easily.

The Grail itself is comprised of two parts: a cup made of reddish-brown agate stone, and a carved gold reliquary into which the cup is set. In the 1960s, an archaeological study concluded that the cup portion dated back to the 2nd or 1st Century BCE and was made by hand in a location between ancient Palestine and Egypt, the only place where that type of agate is found.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EVia her research, art historian and author Dr Ana Maf&eacute; learned that the gold stand dated to the 11th Century, suggesting that the artisans of that time knew that the top cup was a special relic and wanted to showcase it.

He explained that \"it both absorbs and releases heat slowly. During the day, as the sun beats upon the wall, the heat from the sun slowly absorbs into the wall. As night falls, that heat is slowly released, [helping] earthen buildings remain a comfortable temperature.\" This simple natural effect has made adobe building still popular today and explains the endurance of Yemen's mud-architecture.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIncredibly, construction usually didn't use scaffolding. Instead, master builders would start with a stone foundation, often some 2m deep, upon which mud bricks were laid in a running bond, meaning one brick is overlapped by two above. They then slowly built upwards, placing wooden joists for strength and adding floors made from wood and palm materials as they went higher up. Scaffolding was generally only used at a later date, once the house was finished and needed replastering or restoration.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, according to Damluji, these building skills are on the brink of extinction. \"We are looking at structures that can stand for up to 300 years and more.

Because rabbits and rats wreak havoc on these ground-nesting birds, his team eradicated them. Crucially, they also discovered that, because they need open, sandy soil on which to lay their eggs, sooty terns could not nest beneath the coconut palm trees, of which there were far too many on Bird. Savy cleared the coconut trees from the island's north.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlmost immediately, the sooty terns returned: in season, there are now an estimated 350,000 breeding pairs, although the number has reached 500,000 in the past. The sooty terns on Bird nest, says Bristol, at a density of seven nests per square metre, spread across the 13-hectare breeding colony. Bird Island is now one of the world's largest bird breeding colonies &ndash; and, said Bristol, one of the most important and best-managed such colonies anywhere in the Seychelles archipelago.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith so many sooty terns on an island that covers less than 1 sq km of land, it's easy to imagine that there would be little room for anything else.

The waters were rich in fish and the year-round climate &ndash; Seychelles lies beyond the Indian Ocean cyclone zone &ndash; was conducive to the establishment of small plantations where, until slavery was abolished in 1835, enslaved Africans often did most of the work growing food. The location, too, combined deep-ocean isolation with a safe harbour for passing ships that carried with them spices and culinary influences from Europe, Africa, India and China. In this complicated confluence of factors was born Seychelles' unique tradition of Creole cooking (the word &lsquo;Creole&rsquo; is the adjective locals use to describe the people, language and cuisine of Seychelles).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I arrived in Seychelles in January, I expected a sampling of Creole dishes to be a major highlight of my visit.

Yes, almost every local with whom I spoke wanted to talk about the wonders of their national cuisine. And yes, they told a story of dishes filled with spices, flavours and natural ingredients. But almost in the same breath they apologised for how difficult it would be for me to try these dishes. It was, they said, a familiar story of globalisation, of how a younger generation of Seychellois were far more interested in fast food &ndash; pizza, hamburgers and the like &ndash; than local foods. Many restaurants were, they assured me, moving away from traditional dishes and towards catering to this new generation's appetite for everything new and foreign.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHoping they were wrong, worried that they may be right, I set out to try and unearth what remained of Seychelle's culinary tradition.

Now retired, Philos is widely considered a pioneer of modern Seychellois cooking. Another of Seychelles' premier chefs and culinary identities, Christelle Verheyden, joined us as well. Between them they brought to the table nearly a century of local and international experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt first, they confirmed what I'd been told: \"We're losing a lot,\" said Rose-Marie. \"And we're losing it fast.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20220209-the-hidden-legacy-of-the-seychelles-island-cuisine-2"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":[],"imageAlignment":"left","imageAltText":"White house in Le Jardin Du Roi Spice Garden, Mahe Island, Seychelles","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20220209-the-hidden-legacy-of-the-seychelles-island-cuisine-3"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EBut I wanted to know exactly what it was that was being lost, and over the hours that followed, they told a story of great variety and abundance. \"I had a guest who stayed with us for one month,\" remembered Philos. \"He ate every day in the restaurant. I made a bet with him: for every day that he ate in my restaurant, he would eat a different kind of fish. We did it. It was easy &ndash; 27 or 28 different kinds.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey also spoke about the intricacies of individual dishes that Seychellois hold dear. Should the bones be left in an authentic Creole chicken curry? They should. Do you roast the cardamom and other spices before cooking the curry? Absolutely. Do you mix notoriously fiery Seychelles chillies into an octopus curry or serve it separately? Either is fine.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe three of them laughed at the audacity of some of the dishes that Philos and Rose-Marie prepared back in the day.

Longing for the homeland they'd been brutally ripped from, the residents set up their own close-knit community to blend their African traditions with American folkways, raising cattle and farming the land. One of the first towns established and controlled by African Americans in the US, Africatown had its own churches, barbershops, stores (one of which was owned by Patterson's uncle); and the Mobile County Training School, a public school that became the backbone of the community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this once-vibrant neighbourhood fell on hard times when a freeway was constructed in the heart of it in 1991, and industrial pollution meant that many of the remaining residents eventually packed up and left. \"We couldn't even hang out our washing to dry because it would get covered in ash [a product of the oil storage tanks and factories on the outskirts of Africatown],\" said Patterson. With the high-profile closure of the corrugated box factory, International Paper, in 2000, and an ensuing public health lawsuit brought about by residents, Africatown's community that had swelled to 12,000 people in the 1960s plummeted to around 2,000, where it stands today.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20220207-the-last-known-ship-of-the-us-slave-trade-4"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":["p0bl7hbx"],"imageAlignment":"left","imageAltText":"A marker commemorating Cudjoe Kazoola Lewis, one of the Clotilda survivors","imageOrientation":"portrait","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20220207-the-last-known-ship-of-the-us-slave-trade-5"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EThe exodus, poverty and environmental scars were visible as Patterson drove further into Africatown.
