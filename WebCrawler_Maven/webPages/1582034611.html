                  <p>In a complex, fast-paced world of soundbites, knee-jerk opinions and information overload, BBC Future provides something different: a home for slowing down, delving deep and shifting perspectives.</p> 
                  <p>We look for answers to the issues facing the world in science. You’ll find stories here on almost every topic that matters. Psychology. Food. Climate change. Health. Social trends. Technology.</p> 
                  <p>What links them all is our approach. Through evidence-based analysis, original thinking, and powerful storytelling, we shine a light on the hidden ways that the world is changing – and provide solutions for how to navigate it. Energised by the everyday, we think no topic is too small to be fascinating. Inspired by obstacles, we believe no subject is too overwhelming to tackle.</p> 
                  <p>We're the proud recipients of both the <a href="https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/2019/websites/features-design/best-writing-editorial/bbc-future/?/">2019 Webby Award for best writing</a> and the <a href="https://winners.lovieawards.eu/?_ga=2.164830463.1577411724.1570623047-290217417.1570623047#!w=34">2019 Lovie Award for best writing</a>. Our writing also won <a href="https://mjauk.org/2021/09/23/the-2021-mja-awards-winners-so-much-to-celebrate/">two Medical Journalist Association Awards in 2021</a> while another piece was highly commended by the judges.&nbsp;</p>

With no vehicles plying the streets and with industrial activity slowing considerably, the reduced emissions led to a significant decrease in atmospheric aerosols. These are tiny solid and liquid droplets suspended in the atmosphere, and they include microscopic particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5) harmful to human health. Aerosols include sulphur dioxide, from burning coal, and black carbon or soot.

We got this figure using a test story, calculating emissions as above and then dividing that by the pageviews that the test story actually had over six months. That gives us a better estimate than just plugging in the URL from a story to the agency&rsquo;s standard carbon calculator, because for a story where the number of pageviews is a weighty factor in the equation, using data on actual pageviews makes it more accurate.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe story we used as a test to get this figure was a BBC Future story, and we used the actual number of pageviews it had over a six-month period.
