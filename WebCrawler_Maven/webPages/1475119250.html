             “SIM-free” means your iPhone doesn’t ship with a carrier nano-SIM. The SIM-free iPhone sold on apple.com and at the Apple Store is unlocked. That means you can use a nano-SIM or eSIM from any carrier that provides service for iPhone.<sup>*</sup>

            <br> If Sprint is your carrier, you’ll need to get a new nano-SIM card in order to activate your iPhone SE. 
            <br> 
            <br> <sup>*</sup> Use of eSIM requires a wireless service plan (which may include restrictions on switching service providers and roaming, even after contract expiration). Not all carriers support eSIM. Use of eSIM in iPhone may be disabled when purchased from some carriers. See your carrier for details.

             iPhone SE comes in three capacities: 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. The term “GB“ stands for gigabytes. The more gigabytes you have, the more content you can store on your iPhone, such as apps, games, photos, HD&nbsp;videos, music, and movies. If you have a large music or photo library or lots of apps, it’s a good idea to consider an iPhone with a larger capacity. If you rarely download apps or you don’t take many photos or&nbsp;videos, an iPhone with a smaller capacity may be better for you.
