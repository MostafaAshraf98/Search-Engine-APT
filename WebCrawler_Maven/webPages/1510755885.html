Radio Mystery Theater and Mystery Theater, sometimes abbreviated as CBSRMT) was a radio drama series created by Himan Brown that was broadcast on CBS Radio Network affiliates from 1974 to 1982, and later in the early 2000s was carried by the NPR satellite feed.\r\nThe format was similar to that of classic old time radio shows like The Mysterious Traveler and The Whistler, in that the episodes were introduced by a host (E. G. Marshall) who provided pithy wisdom and commentary throughout. Unlike the hosts of those earlier programs, Marshall is fully mortal, merely someone whose heightened insight and erudition plunge the listener into the world of the macabre (in a manner similar to that of \"The Man in Black\" on yet another old time radio program, Suspense).\r\nAs with Himan Brown's prior Inner Sanctum Mysteries, each episode of CBS Radio Mystery Theater opened and closed with the ominous sound of a creaking crypt door, accompanied by Marshall's disturbing utterance, \"Come in!… Welcome. I'm E. G. Marshall.\" This was followed by one of Marshall's other catchphrases, usually either \"The sound of suspense\" or \"The fear you can hear.\" At the conclusion, the door would swing shut, preceded by Marshall's classic sign off, \"Until next time, pleasant… dreams?\" Marshall hosted the program from January 1974 until February 1982, when actress Tammy Grimes took over for the series' last season, maintaining the format.\r\nCBSRMT was broadcast each weeknight, at first with a new program each night. Later in the run three or four episodes were new originals each week, and the remainder repeats. There were 1,399 original episodes. The total number of broadcasts, including reruns, was 2,969. Each episode was allotted a full hour of airtime, but after commercials and news, episodes typically ran for about 45 minutes."},"playbackStatus":{"status":"Unknown","timeLeft":""}},"context":{"token":"BgcHAAIAAgABAAEAoKAMe-T1BQEHEzIAAAATMgAAAA"}},{"guideId":"p962325","index":3,"type":"Program","containerType":"Undefined","image":"https://cdn-profiles.tunein.com/p962325/images/logod.png?t=157972","accessibilityTitle":"Down These Mean Streets (Old Time Radio Detectives)","title":"Down These Mean Streets (Old Time Radio Detectives)","subtitle":"Presenting the best detectives from the Golden Age of Radio.

The show takes its name from the police term \"dragnet\", meaning a system of coordinated measures for apprehending criminals or suspects. Dragnet is perhaps the most famous and influential police procedural drama in media history. The series gave audience members a feel for the danger and heroism of police work. Dragnet earned praise for improving the public opinion of police officers. Actor and producer Jack Webb's aims in Dragnet were for realism and unpretentious acting; he achieved both goals, and Dragnet remains a key influence on subsequent police dramas in many media. The show's cultural impact is such that after five decades, elements of Dragnet are familiar to those who have never seen or heard the program: The ominous, four-note introduction to the brass and tympani theme music (titled \"Danger Ahead\") is instantly recognizable (though its origins date to Miklós Rózsa's score for the 1946 film version of The Killers). Another Dragnet trademark is the show's opening narration: \"Ladies and gentlemen: the story you are about to hear is true. Only the names have been changed to protect the innocent.\" This underwent minor revisions over time. The \"only\" and \"ladies and gentlemen\" were dropped at some point, and for the television version \"hear\" was changed to \"see\". Variations on this narration have been featured in subsequent crime dramas, and in parodies of the dramas (e.g. \"Only the facts have been changed to protect the guilty\")."},"playbackStatus":{"status":"Unknown","timeLeft":""}},"context":{"token":"BgcHAAQABAABAAEAoKAMe-T1BQEHEzIAAAATMgAAAA"}},{"guideId":"p894268","index":5,"type":"Program","containerType":"Undefined","image":"https://cdn-profiles.tunein.com/p894268/images/logod.png?t=1","accessibilityTitle":"Radio Detective Story Hour","title":"Radio Detective Story Hour","subtitle":"Listen to radio's famous gumshoes and well-remembered cops.

Paley, a fan of the Philip Marlowe radio series, asked his programming chief, Hubell Robinson, to develop a hardboiled Western series, a show about a \"Philip Marlowe of the Old West\". Robinson instructed his West Coast CBS Vice President, Harry Ackerman, who had developed the Philip Marlowe series, to take on the task.\r\nAckerman and his scriptwriters, Mort Fine and David Friedkin, created an audition script called \"Mark Dillon Goes to Gouge Eye\" based on one of their Michael Shayne radio scripts, \"The Case of the Crooked Wheel\" from the summer of 1948. Two versions were recorded. The first, recorded in June 1949, was very much like a hardboiled detective series and starred Michael Rye (credited as Rye Billsbury) as Dillon; the second, recorded in July 1949, starred Straight Arrow actor Howard Culver in a more Western, lighter version of the same script. CBS liked the Culver version better, and Ackerman was told to proceed.\r\nA complication arose, though; Culver's contract as the star of Straight Arrow would not allow him to do another Western series. The project was shelved for three years when producer Norman Macdonnell and writer John Meston discovered it while creating an adult Western series of their own.\r\nMacdonnell and Meston wanted to create a radio Western for adults, in contrast to the prevailing juvenile fare such as The Lone Ranger and The Cisco Kid. Gunsmoke was set in Dodge City, Kansas, during the thriving cattle days of the 1870s. Dunning notes, \"The show drew critical acclaim for unprecedented realism.\"\r\nRadio cast and character biographies\r\nThe radio series first aired on CBS on April 26, 1952, with the episode \"Billy the Kid\", written by Walter Newman, and ended on June 18, 1961. The show stars William Conrad as Marshal Matt Dillon, Howard McNear as Doc Charles Adams, Georgia Ellis as Kitty Russell, and Parley Baer as Dillon's assistant, Chester Wesley Proudfoot."},"playbackStatus":{"status":"Unknown","timeLeft":""}},"context":{"token":"BgcHABEAEQABAAEAoKAMe-T1BQEHEzIAAAATMgAAAA"}},{"guideId":"p1287612","index":18,"type":"Program","containerType":"Undefined","image":"https://cdn-profiles.tunein.com/p1287612/images/logod.png?t=1","accessibilityTitle":"Stars on Suspense (Old Time Radio)","title":"Stars on Suspense (Old Time Radio)","subtitle":"Presenting the biggest legends of Hollywood starring in \"Suspense,\" radio's outstanding theater of thrills!

Episodes typically open with a client visiting or calling cash-strapped Diamond's office and agreeing to his fee of $100 a day plus expenses, or Diamond taking on a case at the behest of his friend and former partner, Lt. Walter Levinson. Diamond often suffers a blow to the head in his sleuthing pursuits. Most episodes end with Diamond at the piano, singing a standard, popular song, or showtune from Powell's repertoire to his girlfriend, Helen Asher, in her penthouse at 975 Park Avenue.\r\nLevinson was played variously by Ed Begley, Arthur Q. Bryan, Ted DeCorsia and Alan Reed. Helen was played by Virginia Gregg and others. Another regular cast member included Wilms Herbert as Walt's bumbling sergeant, Otis, who also \"doubled\" on the show as Helen's butler, Francis.\r\nMany of the shows were either written or directed by Edwards. Its theme, \"Leave It to Love\", was whistled by Powell at the beginning of each episode."},"playbackStatus":{"status":"Unknown","timeLeft":""}},"context":{"token":"BgcHABYAFgABAAEAoKAMe-T1BQEHEzIAAAATMgAAAA"}},{"guideId":"p1070204","index":23,"type":"Program","containerType":"Undefined","image":"https://cdn-profiles.tunein.com/p1070204/images/logod.png","accessibilityTitle":"This Podcast Has Fleas","title":"This Podcast Has Fleas","subtitle":"What happens when rival pets have dueling podcasts?
