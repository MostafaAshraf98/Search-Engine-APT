        <p><strong>17 DISPUTES</strong></p> 
        <p><strong>17.1</strong></p> 
        <p>Notices.&nbsp; We may send you notice with respect to the Site by sending an email message to the email address you have provided when redeeming your Voucher or by posting a notice on the Site. Notices shall become effective immediately. Any notices will be deemed delivered to the party receiving such communication (i) the date we post the notice to the Site, or (ii) the date of transmittal if sent via email.</p> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        <p><strong>17.2</strong></p> 
        <p>Severability. No Waiver.&nbsp; If any provisions of these Terms, either in whole or in part, is held to be illegal, invalid, void as against public policy, or unenforceable for any reason under present or future law, such provision shall be fully severable without effect on the remaining provisions, which shall continue in full force and effect and remain legal, valid, effective, and enforceable as if the illegal, invalid, void, or unenforceable provision(s) had never comprised a part of such provision or these Terms, as applicable. In lieu of the illegal, invalid, void, or unenforceable provision, there shall be added a provision as similar in terms and legal effect to the illegal, invalid, void, or unenforceable provision as may be possible and which may be legal, valid, effective and enforceable.</p> 
        <p>Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion</p> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        <p><strong>17.3</strong></p> 
        <p>Arbitration. No Class Action.&nbsp; Unless otherwise required by applicable law, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Site, Services, Terms or breach of Terms (each a “Dispute”) shall be settled exclusively by Arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its commercial arbitration rules, and where appropriate, the AAA’s supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”) both of which are available at the AAA website at www.adr.org.&nbsp; You understand that absent this section you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial and are hereby waiving that right.</p> 
        <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration, including a description of your claim, to our registered agent. Either party may be able to recover attorney’s fees in arbitration as if the dispute were in court as available under applicable law. The arbitration will be conducted solely based on written submissions unless the arbitrator determines that a telephone or in-person hearing is necessary. A decision by the arbitrator (including all findings of fact and conclusions of law) shall be confidential unless otherwise required to be disclosed by law. A decision may also not be used in any litigation or arbitration involving any other person.</p> 
        <p>Notwithstanding anything to this contrary in this section, each of us may bring a suit in court where otherwise stated, including to enjoin, infringement, unauthorized access or improper use of computer networks, customer data, misappropriation or theft of intellectual property, or other violation of your obligations under Section 7 Intellectual Property, of these Terms.</p> 
        <p>All arbitration proceedings shall be individual arbitration. You expressly agree that no other claims may be joined with your claims. You further agree that you have voluntarily waived the right to file or join a lawsuit in state or federal court, a right to a jury trial, and the right to file or join a class action lawsuit, and expressly acknowledge that the parties reject class arbitration. Neither you nor we shall be entitled to join, sue on behalf of a putative class or consolidated claims, or arbitrate any claim as a representative or in a class action.</p> 
        <p>If any part of this Section of this Agreement, with the exception of the waiver of class action or class arbitration, is deemed invalid or unenforceable by any arbitrator or court, that provision shall be severed and the balance of this Agreement shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the unenforceable provision were not included. If the class action or class arbitration waiver is found to unenforceable, then the entire arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p> 
        <p>The location of any dispute resolution, by arbitration or litigation, shall be in Chicago, IL in the United States. Similarly, any action to enforcement an arbitration award must be brought in the state courts of the State of Illinois located in Chicago, IL. You irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.</p> 
        <p><strong>17.4</strong></p> 
        <p>Governing Law. The validity, construction, and interpretation of the Terms, and the rights and duties of the parties hereto, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois in the United States, excluding its conflicts of laws principles.</p>
