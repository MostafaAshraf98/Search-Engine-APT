    <p class="line874">Most software developers waste thousands of hours working with overly complex code. <span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span></p>
    <p class="line862">The eight core principles in <em>The Art of Clean Code</em> will teach you how to write clear, maintainable code without compromising functionality. <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span></p>
    <ol type="1">

    <p class="line874">Adam Schroeder, Christian Mayer, and Ann Marie Ward <span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span></p>
    <p class="line867"><strong>Book Overview:</strong> <span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span></p>
    <p class="line874">Create stunning interactive dashboard applications in Python with the Dash visualization and data analysis tool. Build interfaces that make sense of your data, and make it pretty. <span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span></p>
    <p class="line874">A swift and practical introduction to building interactive data visualization apps in Python, known as dashboards. You’ve seen dashboards before; think election result visualizations you can update in real time, or population maps you can filter by demographic. With the Python Dash library you’ll create analytic dashboards that present data in effective, usable, elegant ways in just a few lines of code. <span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span></p>
    <p class="line874">The book is fast-paced and caters to those entirely new to dashboards. It will talk you through the necessary software, then get straight into building the dashboards themselves. You’ll learn the basic format of a Dash app by building a Twitter analysis dashboard that maps the number of likes certain accounts gained over time. You’ll build up skills through three more sophisticated projects. The first is a global analysis app that compares country data in three areas: the percentage of a population using the internet, percentage of parliament seats held by women, and CO2 emissions. You’ll then build an investment portfolio dashboard, and an app that allows you to visualize and explore machine learning algorithms. <span class="anchor" id="line-37"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-38"></span></p>
    <p class="line874">In this book you will: <span class="anchor" id="line-39"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-40"></span></p>
    <ul>
     <li>Create and run your first Dash apps <span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span></li>
     <li>Use the pandas library to manipulate and analyze social media data <span class="anchor" id="line-42"></span></li>
     <li>Use Git to download and build on existing apps written by the pros <span class="anchor" id="line-43"></span></li>
     <li>Visualize machine learning models in your apps <span class="anchor" id="line-44"></span></li>
     <li>Create and manipulate statistical and scientific charts and maps using Plotly <span class="anchor" id="line-45"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-46"></span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="line874">Dash combines several technologies to get you building dashboards quickly and efficiently. This book will do the same. <span class="anchor" id="line-47"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-48"></span></p>

And what better choice than Python could have been? An easy to understand language to explain an uneasy to understand topic. This book is designed for absolute beginners with elementary knowledge of Python language. Regular Expressions are considered as a tough topic and usually they are not covered in syllabus in much detail. Mostly, a chapter is given on this topic in syllabus or curriculum books. But here, a complete book is dedicated. This book covers Regular Expression in detail with plenty of examples covering password validation, email ID validation, string manipulations etc. and their step by step analysis. The examples are presented in such a way that one can feel like coding only by reading the codes itself. The book is written in a way to give stress free environment. <span class="anchor" id="line-115"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-116"></span></p>

    <p class="line867"><strong>Book Overview:</strong> <span class="anchor" id="line-127"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-128"></span></p>
    <p class="line862">Learning to program is hard. Don’t let anyone tell you different. If you bought or are considering buying this book because someone told you that you should learn Python, then maybe you should reconsider. The big question to ask yourself is <em>“Do you want to learn Python?”</em> Certainly, this book will help you answer that question, but be prepared to struggle, and to make mistakes, and to get frustrated, and to bang your head against the keyboard. This is Pandora’s box, baby, but… <span class="anchor" id="line-129"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-130"></span></p>
    <p class="line862">If you get excited by solving hard problems… if you’re into Sudoku, or crosswords, or jigsaw puzzles, or if you’ll spend hours trying to figure out how to separate two metal looping thingamajigs that you found on someone’s shelf…, or you like tinkering with engines, or figuring out the best recipe for chocolate chip cookies… in other words, if you like a challenge, then you might love Python programming.It’s not easy, but it’s easy enough to get started. Pick up a book (good start!), and start going through it. Be patient with yourself. Pretend you’re the teacher as well as the student. When the student fails, the good teacher doesn’t insult or chastise. The good teacher encourages. The good teacher knows that failure is a part of learning, and that overcoming failure is exciting and leads to more learning. <strong>So, be a good teacher and treat yourself well.</strong> <span class="anchor" id="line-131"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-132"></span></p>
    <p class="line867"><strong>But be a good student too.</strong> When reading this book, you should be sitting at your computer. When you first begin, plan to spend at least two uninterrupted hours. You should do your best to get through the first two lessons in the first sitting. That will get you through the foundational learning. From there on out, you’ll be hopping back and forth between the book and viewing, editing, and writing code. Go through the book slowly and methodically. Read every demo carefully. Work through every exercise. You cannot learn to code through reading alone. You must practice. <span class="anchor" id="line-133"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-134"></span></p>
    <p class="line874">This book assume no prior knowledge of Python, but it introduces some pretty advanced topics, such as working with databases, scraping the web, and object-oriented Python. <span class="anchor" id="line-135"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-136"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-137"></span></p>

    <p class="line874">The very nature of IoT requires a knowledge of a programming language and electronic circuits and a knowledge of networking in order to interface with the physical world and networking platforms. Learning IoT with Python and Raspberry Pi uses a cross-disciplinary approach when teaching IoT. Circuits which use light dependent resistors, LEDs, buzzers, passive infrared sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and other components will be used to explore and elucidate programming concepts. Users can monitor devices connected to the Raspberry Pi. Learning IoT with Python and Raspberry Pi allows the programmer to explore the Internet of Things (IoT) by writing code which will monitor temperature, pressure, humidity, and light levels and will determine when motion is detected, etc. Based upon these physical events, a text message is sent, an email is sent, a phone call is made, or a picture is taken. <span class="anchor" id="line-152"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-153"></span></p>

    <p class="line867"><strong>The key to mastering programming is to truly understand why we do things</strong> in the way we do them. Learning the methods is not enough. My focus in the years I’ve spent teaching coding has been to get my students to think in the way the computer does. Only then can we speak its language. We need to understand the various tools in a coding language as if they’re our best friends, not just mere acquaintances. <span class="anchor" id="line-189"></span>The focus of this book is <strong>real</strong> understanding. ‘Why’ is just as important a question as ‘How’. <span class="anchor" id="line-190"></span>And I like analogies—a lot. So your journey through learning how to code will take you through The White Room and coffee machines, and you’ll even climb a tree! <span class="anchor" id="line-191"></span>This book will start from the basics, and in its second part will start to move towards areas of programming relevant to fields such as science, finance, and other data-driven fields. <span class="anchor" id="line-192"></span>The Table of contents of the book is the following: <span class="anchor" id="line-193"></span></p>

    <p class="line862">This book will help readers develop readable, reliable, and maintainable programs in Python. Starting with an introduction to the concept of modules and packages, this book shows how you can use these building blocks to organize a complex program into logical parts and make sure those parts are working correctly together. Using clearly written, real-world examples, this book demonstrates how you can use modular techniques to build better programs. A number of common modular programming patterns are covered, including divide-and-conquer, abstraction, encapsulation, wrappers and extensibility. You will also learn how to test your modules and packages, how to prepare your code for sharing with other people, and how to publish your modules and packages on <a class="nonexistent" href="/moin/GitHub">GitHub</a> and the Python Package Index so that other people can use them. Finally, you will learn how to use modular design techniques to be a more effective programmer. <span class="anchor" id="line-562"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-563"></span></p>

    <p class="line874">Getting started with programming can be an intimidating challenge. Most books and tutorials assume lots of previous knowledge, skip over jargon and new concepts, and use examples that only make sense if you already understand programming. <span class="anchor" id="line-846"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-847"></span></p>
    <p class="line874">This book is different. It gives you an introduction to programming in Python from the ground up, starting with tips on installation and setting up your programming environment, and moving through the core parts of the Python language in a logical order. Dr. Jones has drawn on his many years experience teaching programming to produce a book that will guide you through the language step by step in simple terms. <span class="anchor" id="line-848"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-849"></span></p>
    <p class="line874">The book doesn't assume any previous knowledge, and introduces fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops and functions using simple terms and easy-to-follow examples that you can run and modify. <span class="anchor" id="line-850"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-851"></span></p>
    <p class="line874">The book takes a unique approach to practical exercises. Rather than simply presenting you with the solutions, it shows you how large, complex programs are gradually built up from simple building blocks, explaining the role of every line. You can download the examples and exercise solutions - edit, modify and run them yourself. <span class="anchor" id="line-852"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-853"></span></p>

    <p class="line862">Geospatial data is hard to ignore. Nearly every car, phone, or camera has a GPS sensor, and aerial photos, satellite imagery, and data representing political boundaries, roads, rivers, and streams are available for free download from many websites. Geoprocessing is the science of reading, analyzing, and presenting geospatial data programmatically. The Python language, along with dozens of open source libraries and tools, makes it possible to take on professional geoprocessing tasks without investing in expensive proprietary packages like ArcGIS and <a class="nonexistent" href="/moin/MapInfo">MapInfo</a>. <span class="anchor" id="line-863"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-864"></span></p>
    <p class="line874">Geoprocessing with Python teaches you how to use the Python programming language along with free and open source tools to read, write, and process geospatial data. You'll learn how to access available data sets to make maps or perform your own analyses using free and open source tools like the GDAL, Shapely, and Fiona Python modules. You'll master core practices like handling multiple vector file formats, editing and manipulating geometries, applying spatial and attribute filters, working with projections, and performing basic analyses on vector data. You'll also learn how to create geospatial data, rather than just consuming it. The book also covers how to manipulate and analyze raster data, such as aerial photographs, satellite images, and digital elevation models. <span class="anchor" id="line-865"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-866"></span></p>

    <p class="line874">This book is for Python programmers who are beginners in machine learning, but want to learn Machine learning. Readers are expected to know Python and be able to install and use open-source libraries. They are not expected to know machine learning, although the book can also serve as an introduction to some Python libraries for readers who know machine learning. This book does not go into the detail of the mathematics behind the algorithms. <span class="anchor" id="line-965"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-966"></span></p>
    <p class="line874">This book primarily targets Python developers who want to learn and build machine learning in their projects, or who want to provide machine learning support to their existing projects, and see them getting implemented effectively. <span class="anchor" id="line-967"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-968"></span></p>

Head First Programming introduces the core concepts of writing computer programs--variables, decisions, loops, functions, and objects--which apply regardless of the programming language, but uses concrete examples and exercises in the dynamic and versatile Python language to apply and reinforce these concepts. <span class="anchor" id="line-1112"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1113"></span></p>
    <p class="line874">Learn the basic tools to start writing the programs that interests you, not the generic software someone else thinks you should have, and get a better understanding of what software can (and cannot) do. When you're finished, you'll have the necessary foundation to apply to whatever language or software project you need or want to learn. <span class="anchor" id="line-1114"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1115"></span></p>

    <p class="line874">The book teaches solid procedural style programming, then builds on that to teach solid object-oriented programming, and then goes on to more advanced topics such as descriptors and class decorators. But even newcomers to Python 3 should be able to write useful (although small and basic) programs after reading chapter 1, and then go on to create larger and more sophisticated programs as they work through the chapters. <span class="anchor" id="line-1127"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1128"></span></p>
    <p class="line862">The book's <a class="http" href="http://www.qtrac.eu/py3book.html">web site</a> lists the table of contents and has links to extracts.

    <p class="line874">Python for Software Design is a concise introduction to software design using the Python programming language. Intended for people with no programming experience, this book starts with the most basic concepts and gradually adds new material. Some of the ideas students find most challenging, like recursion and object-oriented programming, are divided into a sequence of smaller steps and introduced over the course of several chapters. The focus is on the programming process, with special emphasis on debugging. The book includes a wide range of exercises, from short examples to substantial projects, so that students have ample opportunity to practice each new concept. Exercise solutions and code examples are available from thinkpython.com, along with Swampy, a suite of Python programs that is used in some of the exercises. <span class="anchor" id="line-1138"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1139"></span></p>

Plus, programming is fun! <span class="anchor" id="line-1149"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1150"></span></p>
    <p class="line874">Hello World! provides a gentle but thorough introduction to the world of computer programming. It's written in language a 12-year-old can follow, but anyone who wants to learn how to program a computer can use it. Even adults. Written by Warren Sande and his son, Carter, and reviewed by professional educators, this book is kid-tested and parent-approved. You don't need to know anything about programming to use the book. But you should know the basics of using a computer--e-mail, surfing the web, listening to music, and so forth. If you can start a program and save a file, you should have no trouble using this book. <span class="anchor" id="line-1151"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1152"></span></p>

    <p class="line862">The main goal of this book is comprehensively teaching you the core of the Python language, much more than just its syntax (which you don't really need a book to learn, right?). Knowing more about how Python works under the covers, including the relationship between data objects and memory management, will make you a much more <strong>effective</strong> Python programmer coming out of the gate. The advanced topics chapters are meant as complete intros or "quick dives" into each of those distinct subjects. However, if moving towards those specific areas of development, they are more than enough to get you pointed in the right direction. We would say that the book is 40% introductory, 40% intermediate (in-depth core Python material plus advanced topics chapters), and 20% reference -- it is *not* meant to be a substitute for a pure reference such as the <em>Python Essential Reference</em> or <em>Python in a Nutshell</em>. <span class="anchor" id="line-1261"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1262"></span></p>
    <p class="line874">The new 2nd edition is expanded (300 new pages!) and updated through Python 2.5 as well as confirmed functionality for future versions! Also added are a few new chapters of advanced material. As in the 1st edition, a plethora of easy to advanced exercises can be found at the end of every chapter to hammer the concepts home. At the moment, this is the most complete and up-to-date Python book on the market today. <span class="anchor" id="line-1263"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1264"></span></p>
    <p class="line874">From an anonymous reviewer: "Very well written. It is the clearest, friendliest book I have come across yet for explaining Python, and putting it in a wider context. It does not presume a large amount of other experience. It may be too slow for more advanced people, but it does go into some important Python topics carefully and in depth. Unlike too many beginner books, it never condescends or tortures the reader with childish hide-and-seek prose games. Not too many in-depth real-world examples in the book (hopefully he will do a followup volume), it sticks to gaining a solid grasp of Python syntax and structure." <span class="anchor" id="line-1265"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1266"></span></p>
