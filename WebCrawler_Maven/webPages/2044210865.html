As a reader you know how you relate to those stories as part of your life, as part of you, and your memories which is why we want you to think of this podcast as you sitting with friends, reminiscing about your time with those characters. Both of us have a great passion for reading and hope to connect with a larger reading community. So this is to all our book dragons out there.
