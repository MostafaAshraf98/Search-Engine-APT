               After two years of remote work, spending a day in the office can be a shock to the wallet – and rising costs are making it worse.

                  <p>“It’s time for Americans to get back to work&nbsp;and fill our great downtowns again,” President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/03/01/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-delivered/">said</a> earlier this year. He’s not the only political leader calling for workers to head back to the office. “Mother Nature does not like working from home,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/454769a7-2d96-4d82-9a00-599ca9eb5c2e">announced</a> late last year, as he predicted a wholesale return to pre-pandemic commuting levels.&nbsp;</p> 
                  <p>It’s not surprising that political leaders want us back at our desks. Without daily commutes and dining ‘al desko’, businesses of all types and sizes are losing out financially. One day of commuting is worth <a href="https://news.railbusinessdaily.com/research-shows-business-boost-from-work-return-but-staff-and-employers-have-different-expectations/#:~:text=One%20day%20of%20commuting%20is,the%20course%20of%20a%20year">£82m</a> ($107m) to businesses in the UK; in the US, workers spent <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/average-spending-on-commute-how-much-money-2019-7?r=US&amp;IR=T">between $2,000 and $5,000</a> (£1,536–£3,840) on transport to work alone each year before the pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
                  <p>But there’s a problem. Employees who haven’t had to budget for train tickets, takeaway coffees or new office outfits for the past two years are now acutely aware of how much it costs to spend a day at your desk. And, worse, these costs are growing. Petrol prices are at an all-time high; transport fares have increased, and food and other essentials are on an upwards trajectory. That means an office day can hit the wallet hard.<em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
                  <p>Some companies are offering financial and other incentives to tempt unhappy commuters back. But, given how aware workers are now of exactly how much an office day costs, it feels unlikely people will willingly revert to absorbing office-day expenses like before.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
                  <p><strong>‘A quarter of my daily income’</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
                  <p>Claire, a manager at a business events company in London, is certainly far more conscious now of how much she’s spending on her days in the office.</p>

                  <p>When she worked from home during the pandemic, she put the money she usually spent on transport, takeaway lunches, office wear and after-work drinks into a savings pot. “I think I saved something crazy like £6,000 in six months,” she says. But when her employers reinstituted office days, the sudden change in her outgoings came as a shock.&nbsp;</p> 
                  <p>To make matters worse, her return train ticket to work has risen from £35 pre-pandemic to almost £50. “Having a mortgage, the rise in utility bills, council tax, income tax and the rising train fares, it’s just becoming impossible,” she says. Claire’s employer has upped salaries to meet market rates but, says Claire, “it’s really not enough”.&nbsp;</p> 
                  <p>Umus, a lecturer at a London university, experienced a similar post-pandemic price shock. Their commute – a comparatively short distance on the underground – costs £6.40 during rush hour. “When I first went back to the office, I was shocked. It’s just crazy expensive,” says Umus. “People are always saying ‘you can just cycle’, but it’s very ableist, everybody is not capable of cycling seven miles every day.”&nbsp;</p> 
                  <p>At work, Umus finds that expenses accumulate. “I usually grab both breakfast and lunch around work,” says Umus. “The cheapest option is Pret, and very easily, one coffee, one little breakfast thing and lunch, ends up being £13, then I get snacks from Tesco, which isn’t cheap either.” They’ve been working on a strict budget, but still end up spending between £22 and £27 on food and transport every office day. “That’s more than a quarter of what I make per day just to be able to go into the office,” says Umus.</p>

                  <p>When Umus works from home, they prepare their own food – it’s easier with more time and access to a full kitchen. “People say you can bring your own lunch [to the office], but I have a baby at home. I just barely survive, I can't plan lunches as well,” says Umus. “I feel like I should be able to afford a Pret sandwich as a lecturer at [a university in] London, but it’s really pushing the limits of my budget if I do it more than twice a week.”&nbsp;</p> 
                  <p><strong>Soaring costs</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
                  <p>Umus isn’t the only one struggling to cover office-related costs. “Incomes of all types, particularly wages, are just not keeping up with inflation,” says James Smith, research director at London think-tank Resolution Foundation.&nbsp;</p> 
                  <p>According to the UK Office of National Statistics, while wages did technically rise over the last tax year, when accounting for rising costs, workers actually saw a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60734392">1% drop</a> in pay. In the US, the Labor Department <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-drives-worker-pay-down-not-up-wage-price-spiral-raises-goods-keynes-friedman-cost-push-fed-11643662537">reports</a> worker pay has increased by 4% in the past year, well below the 7% increase in prices. In South Africa, worker wages were frozen in 2020 and <a href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/finance/534062/salaries-to-remain-under-pressure-in-south-africa-economists-warn/">climbed 1.5% in 2021</a> – again, well below the estimated inflation of 4.5%.&nbsp;</p> 
                  <p>As wages lag, transport costs are surging. In London, where public transport dominates, fares on buses and the London Underground have seen the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/14/london-tube-and-bus-fares-to-rise-almost-5-from-next-month">biggest rise in a decade</a>, to help recoup pandemic losses. Across the UK, rail costs <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/17/rail-fares-increase-march-inflation">are also going up</a>. In the United States, where the vast majority (over 80%) commute by car, surging gas prices are <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/75d435fc-3e40-41b6-b4f0-0bf74321617a">keeping people</a> from getting behind the wheel. A year ago, petrol in the US cost $2.87 a gallon, now the average has <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/">gone up 50%</a> to $4.10, leaving many commuters struggling.</p>

                  <p>South Africa has seen similar increases. “Wages have been stagnant since the beginning of 2020 and the petrol price just keeps going up and up,” says Tracy Benson, an office manager in Johannesburg. Benson is currently alternating remote and office days, but now South Africa has eased its pandemic rules a push to get back to the office has begun.&nbsp;</p> 
                  <p>“It's gotten to the point where if I were to be forced back into the office full time, I literally can't afford to get there, the petrol would cost me too much,” says Benson.&nbsp;</p> 
                  <p><strong>Subsidies, for some</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
                  <p>These rising costs mean that workers who can do their jobs from home are understandably reluctant to head to the office unless they absolutely need to. In Benson’s case, she’s just hoping her employer keeps allowing home working. “I’m worried the office will push for a full return,” says Benson. “For me, it would honestly mean finding a different job.”&nbsp;</p> 
                  <p>Some companies are cognisant of employees’ concerns and are offering practical solutions aimed at alleviating costs related to office days. Media company Bloomberg is offering its US staff <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/flexible-working-commute-cost#:~:text=The%20dreaded%20commute.,exactly%20how%20to%20spend%20it.">a $75 daily commuting stipend</a>, which they can spend however they want. In the UK, consultancy PwC is giving commuters <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/06/sweet-deal-uk-workers-lured-back-to-office-with-bonuses-and-ice-cream">an extra £1,000</a> to come into the office, while bank Goldman Sachs is offering <a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/news/2021/09/goldman-sachs-free-food">free breakfast and lunch</a> to some workers. But these perks and stipends certainly don’t extend to all companies – meaning people are not only being asked to give up remote work but also spend more to do it. &nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Before the pandemic, people generally absorbed these costs without question. But now they’ve seen the alternative, it’s not as simple as just ‘going back to normal’ – especially if other people are getting better deals.&nbsp;</p> 
                  <p>“It’s an issue of fairness,” says Jean-Nicolas Reyt, assistant professor of organisational behaviour at McGill. He explains that we determine fairness not just based on what our colleagues are receiving, but also what other people doing different jobs at different organisations are getting – so if one company is subsidising their employees’ commutes, then workers elsewhere are likely to want the same benefit.&nbsp;</p> 
                  <p>“People don't stay an unfair situation; they work less, or usually they quit,” adds Reyt. “If some companies start giving people money to commute, this is going to become the norm, the market will readjust.” Reyt encourages employers to pick their battles. “CEOs talk to me as if the goal is to reduce all costs,” he says, but an enforced back-to-office policy, without any perks, will likely have unintended consequences for employee retention. “It’s not worth it to cut corners. The overall costs are so much bigger than these savings.”&nbsp;</p> 
                  <p>Yet even as some workers discuss with their employers how often they’ll return to the office and who will pay, the Resolution Foundation’s Smith points out that those who have the option of working from home are still some of the most fortunate. After all, knowledge workers and those on higher incomes were far more likely to be able to work remotely during the pandemic <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200921-what-remote-jobs-tell-us-about-inequality">than lower-income workers</a>, who will have had no choice but to attend their place of work each day and absorb the related, rising costs.&nbsp;</p> 
                  <p>As Umus says: “I'm one of the lucky ones. So, I don't know how other people manage.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

Employers are having to both widen their net and interview more people as a result of the hiring crisis. That creates a knock-on effect for hiring managers who, whether inside firms or at external recruitment companies, are dealing with a glut of applicants and roles. &ldquo;Much of the ghosting we&rsquo;re seeing today may simply be the fact that someone just can&rsquo;t get back to everyone,&rdquo; says Pringle.&nbsp;&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe loss of in-person interviews may also be a factor in ghosting by both parties. &ldquo;It can sometimes be harder to build a rapport with someone virtually,&rdquo; says Freedberg. &ldquo;The emotional investment of travelling to meet someone for an in-person interview is difficult to replicate when you&rsquo;re clicking on a calendar link from home, and it&rsquo;s easier for employers to ghost when you&rsquo;re losing that human, face-to-face element.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe process can, therefore, feel increasingly transactional.

For one, loss of time &ndash; and sometimes earnings, as in Tahlia&rsquo;s case &ndash; is perhaps the most pervasive problem. Even for roles without prolonged test projects, candidates must set aside time to prepare for an interview (and if doing it face-to-face, factor in a commute). Then, piling intensive interview work on top eats up more bandwidth. And although some candidates can meet these time requirements pre- or post-work, others don&rsquo;t have the same flexibility; for some, these tasks could require unpaid time off from a current job, or special childcare arrangements.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother major issue is candidates are ostensibly doing paid work without the compensation. &ldquo;Asking people to complete a test project or having them come in for a working interview isn&rsquo;t unethical in itself &ndash; the problem lies in not paying candidates,&rdquo; says Latesha Byrd, CEO of talent-development agency Perfeqta, based in North Carolina, US. &ldquo;No matter what term you use, asking candidates to complete working interviews without pay is simply unpaid labour.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, beyond time and pay, proceedings can take an even darker turn when candidates discover companies are using the ideas they submit, free of charge, without permission.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOlivia, who is based in the UK, wasn&rsquo;t looking to move from her company, but a former colleague invited her to apply for a role at an agency. &ldquo;I met the strategy director, and was assigned a task to write a year-long social strategy, with campaign activation tactics, for one of their new clients,&rdquo; she says.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter spending three days on the project, she presented it to a rapt audience, and was soon offered the job.

The inability to provide these details &ndash; or asking for an inordinate amount of free labour &ndash; can serve as huge red flags for candidates, offering a view into how it might feel to be on their payroll.

It&rsquo;s not just happening in tech; in March, the Toronto-based non-profit FoodShare began paying $75 an hour for each candidate&rsquo;s interview as well as the rate of the job they&rsquo;re applying for, if they complete any presentations or assignments.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECandidates find this to be a much more egalitarian approach.

Data from a survey by dating service Match, seen by BBC Worklife, shows 52% of 1,000 single UK adults reported experiencing single shaming &ldquo;since the start of the pandemic&rdquo;, likely due to the increased focus on whom people could rely on during lockdowns.

The multiple burdens that suppress women&rsquo;s achievements won&rsquo;t ease until men take on a greater share of domestic and caring responsibilities, and also become more likely to downsize or adjust their own hours when family circumstances change. But this is challenging in practice. Hegewisch points out that in a heterosexual couple, &ldquo;if one person has to cut back&hellip; for care, it is likely to be the person who earns less in a couple, and that is more likely still to be the woman.&rdquo;&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESome families can make it work, but a certain combination of advantages has to be in place. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re one of the really lucky ones,&rdquo; says Hellen Stirling-Baker, who has just reopened her business, an ethical children&rsquo;s shop in Sheffield, UK, called Small Stuff. During much of lockdown she had to move her shop from bricks-and-mortar to online, but sales haven&rsquo;t suffered hugely. Crucially, she says, she and her husband have been equally dividing domestic tasks and care of their four-year-old son. As he works for a bank and has a more rigid schedule even though he&rsquo;s working from home, he&rsquo;s been taking on the evening shift of cooking dinner and caring for their son, as well as helping her reopen the shop.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe period of temporary &ndash; though hectic &ndash; flexibility for the self-employed Stirling-Baker allowed her to reorient her business and buffer the unpredictability of her son&rsquo;s new life. She&rsquo;s now found a new location for Small Stuff that&rsquo;s larger, allows for social distancing and comes with a rent-free period. It helped that she could compensate for her husband&rsquo;s strict schedule by making her own hours, but that can&rsquo;t continue once the shop is running normally. And the hard work is taking a toll. Stirling-Baker hasn&rsquo;t been sleeping much, she acknowledges, and is focused on the crucial Christmas period for retail sales, while trying not to think too much on the uncertain period beyond that.\u003Cstrong\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EShort-term solutions\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are, of course, things that employers can do to incorporate flexibility and help ease the impact of the pandemic recession on women. Managers can set more realistic expectations and re-evaluate performance criteria &ndash; for instance, not criticising employees for working outside of core hours. This would help relieve the exhaustion that&rsquo;s particularly affecting certain groups of women (although companies that are already crunched may find it hard to be generous).

According to Mich&egrave;le Tertilt, a family economist at the University of Mannheim in Germany, the measure that would help more than any other in curbing the shecession is reopening schools &ndash; especially for the young children whose care is so demanding. As Hegewisch comments, &ldquo;What the crisis has shown is that [telework] will only work if the childcare and education infrastructure is there. I always go through the roof when I see these [images of] glorious days of working from home and you have this dad sitting in front of his computer with a toddler on his knee.

In addition to shutting many childcare facilities, the pandemic may shift demand for care away from big facilities to small, neighbourhood-level providers, sometimes operating from their homes. Local businesses are more attractive when people are being encouraged to stay put, and small providers can more easily reduce the numbers of people mixing.
