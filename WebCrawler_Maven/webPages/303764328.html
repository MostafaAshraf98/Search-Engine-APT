Where once there were hundreds of acres of bogs and marshes around Manchester, there's largely now a uniform patchwork of agricultural fields. It may look bucolic, but the loss of biodiversity that came with the draining of the mosses was colossal. Lowland peatlands have acidic, wet soil that's deficient in nutrients, but that's not to say they're sterile. A host of specialised plants and insects can thrive in these conditions and, where plants and insects abound, other wildlife does too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\"Plants are the fundamental basis of all life on Earth,\" Styles said. \"We lose them at our peril.

Lured to settle on the leaves, an insect would find itself stuck, unable to fly away from the vegetable glue that entrapped it. The sundews' leaves slowly curl around their unfortunate prey, releasing enzymes that dissolve the insect, releasing the nutrients within. The ground in which the sundews grow may be nutrient-deficient, but there's more than one way to feed if you're a plant who's evolved a taste for animal prey.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20210725-the-return-of-britains-meat-eating-plants-4"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":[],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageAltText":"Strands of flowering lesser bladderwort growing in water","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20210725-the-return-of-britains-meat-eating-plants-5"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lancswt.org.uk\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003ECharles Darwin, the great naturalist who unlocked the secrets of evolution in the 19th Century, was obsessed with sundews. He grew them for years, conducting experiments involving them and a succession of unfortunate insects. In 1860, he wrote, \"At the present moment, I care more about \u003Cem\u003EDrosera \u003C\u002Fem\u003E[sundews] than the origin of all the species in the world\", a bold statement coming from the author of the seminal On the Origin of Species.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the story of the sundews, and other carnivorous plants besides that shared the damp surroundings of their north-westerly home, begins some 10,000 years before they caught Darwin's eye, at the time when the bogs of north-west England began to form. On the surface of those early mosses, a tapestry of sphagnum moss and other acid-loving plants abounded and, year by year, added just a little bit more fallen organic matter to the heavy black mass of saturated peat upon which they grew &ndash; an incremental accretion of plant material that, thanks to the wet and acidic ground conditions, didn't rot, and instead compressed to form peat, locking millennia of carbon safely in the ground. Peat bogs cover just 3% of the Earth's surface, but they store more carbon than all the planet's forests combined.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYet what took millennia to form was the work of short decades to undo. As Manchester grew as a city, drainage channels cut by man began to bisect the mosses, slowly but surely drying the elevated peat around them. Peat was extracted and sent into Manchester and, in return, Manchester's inhabitants fertilised the drying, nutrient-poor soil. By the 1880s, the city was producing 200,000 tons of refuse annually, 75% of which was coyly known as \"night soil\". Much of this was transported into the mosses and spread as fertiliser on what was perceived to be an unproductive wasteland. In time, much of the former peat bog became fertile, workable agricultural land.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPeat extraction, for fuel and compost, continued there well into the 20th Century, by which time 98% of the Manchester mosses had been destroyed.

Because rabbits and rats wreak havoc on these ground-nesting birds, his team eradicated them. Crucially, they also discovered that, because they need open, sandy soil on which to lay their eggs, sooty terns could not nest beneath the coconut palm trees, of which there were far too many on Bird. Savy cleared the coconut trees from the island's north.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlmost immediately, the sooty terns returned: in season, there are now an estimated 350,000 breeding pairs, although the number has reached 500,000 in the past. The sooty terns on Bird nest, says Bristol, at a density of seven nests per square metre, spread across the 13-hectare breeding colony.

Even the island's shape resembles a bird: if you look at a satellite image of Bird Island, it resembles in outline a coquettish dove adrift in the Indian Ocean.

The location, too, combined deep-ocean isolation with a safe harbour for passing ships that carried with them spices and culinary influences from Europe, Africa, India and China.
