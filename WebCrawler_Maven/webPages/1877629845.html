Every year, from around mid-September, gliders arrive from across the country hoping to \"surf\" the Morning Glory, as the long, wave-like formations and relatively predictable air movement along the cloud front make for ideal conditions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs with all unpredictable weather events, no-one really knows when the Morning Glory will appear.

Most often, this meant giant tortoises and the solitaire, a fatally plump bird that sailors quickly drove to extinction, just as they had the dodo on Mauritius.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"BodyA\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou may also be interested in:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E &bull;&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Ftravel\u002Farticle\u002F20220302-seychelles-bird-island-a-paradise-with-too-many-palm-trees\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EA paradise with too many palm trees\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E &bull;&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Ftravel\u002Farticle\u002F20200909-a-new-island-of-hope-rising-from-the-indian-ocean\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EThe nation being swallowed by the sea\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E &bull;&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fbbc.com\u002Ftravel\u002Farticle\u002F20220209-the-hidden-legacy-of-the-seychelles-island-cuisine\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EWhat is true \"Creole cuisine\"?\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 1691, Frenchman Fran&ccedil;ois Leguat arrived on the island with seven Huguenots, fleeing religious persecution by France's Catholic government.

The waters were rich in fish and the year-round climate &ndash; Seychelles lies beyond the Indian Ocean cyclone zone &ndash; was conducive to the establishment of small plantations where, until slavery was abolished in 1835, enslaved Africans often did most of the work growing food. The location, too, combined deep-ocean isolation with a safe harbour for passing ships that carried with them spices and culinary influences from Europe, Africa, India and China. In this complicated confluence of factors was born Seychelles' unique tradition of Creole cooking (the word &lsquo;Creole&rsquo; is the adjective locals use to describe the people, language and cuisine of Seychelles).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I arrived in Seychelles in January, I expected a sampling of Creole dishes to be a major highlight of my visit.

Yes, almost every local with whom I spoke wanted to talk about the wonders of their national cuisine. And yes, they told a story of dishes filled with spices, flavours and natural ingredients. But almost in the same breath they apologised for how difficult it would be for me to try these dishes. It was, they said, a familiar story of globalisation, of how a younger generation of Seychellois were far more interested in fast food &ndash; pizza, hamburgers and the like &ndash; than local foods. Many restaurants were, they assured me, moving away from traditional dishes and towards catering to this new generation's appetite for everything new and foreign.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHoping they were wrong, worried that they may be right, I set out to try and unearth what remained of Seychelle's culinary tradition.

Now retired, Philos is widely considered a pioneer of modern Seychellois cooking. Another of Seychelles' premier chefs and culinary identities, Christelle Verheyden, joined us as well. Between them they brought to the table nearly a century of local and international experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt first, they confirmed what I'd been told: \"We're losing a lot,\" said Rose-Marie. \"And we're losing it fast.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20220209-the-hidden-legacy-of-the-seychelles-island-cuisine-2"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":[],"imageAlignment":"left","imageAltText":"White house in Le Jardin Du Roi Spice Garden, Mahe Island, Seychelles","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20220209-the-hidden-legacy-of-the-seychelles-island-cuisine-3"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EBut I wanted to know exactly what it was that was being lost, and over the hours that followed, they told a story of great variety and abundance. \"I had a guest who stayed with us for one month,\" remembered Philos. \"He ate every day in the restaurant. I made a bet with him: for every day that he ate in my restaurant, he would eat a different kind of fish. We did it. It was easy &ndash; 27 or 28 different kinds.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey also spoke about the intricacies of individual dishes that Seychellois hold dear. Should the bones be left in an authentic Creole chicken curry? They should. Do you roast the cardamom and other spices before cooking the curry? Absolutely. Do you mix notoriously fiery Seychelles chillies into an octopus curry or serve it separately? Either is fine.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe three of them laughed at the audacity of some of the dishes that Philos and Rose-Marie prepared back in the day. There was the fruit-bat p&acirc;t&eacute; whose fame reached Seychelles' presidential palace; the then-president used to send his personal driver to Chez Philos to pick up supplies.

Philos swore that he could still find a different fish to cook for every day of the month, just as he had nearly four decades ago. \"Seychelles has the best avocado in the world,\" added Verheyden. \"If you see them on the table at the market or by the side of the road, buy them.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe same is also true of spices.

In the decade following 1895, Bird exported nearly 20,000 tons (20 million kg) of guano (bird droppings) as fertiliser to the sugarcane growers of Mauritius. At the time, 100 people lived on the island. There has never been a town on Bird and the only people living on the island were those working there.

Because rabbits and rats wreak havoc on these ground-nesting birds, his team eradicated them. Crucially, they also discovered that, because they need open, sandy soil on which to lay their eggs, sooty terns could not nest beneath the coconut palm trees, of which there were far too many on Bird. Savy cleared the coconut trees from the island's north.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlmost immediately, the sooty terns returned: in season, there are now an estimated 350,000 breeding pairs, although the number has reached 500,000 in the past. The sooty terns on Bird nest, says Bristol, at a density of seven nests per square metre, spread across the 13-hectare breeding colony. Bird Island is now one of the world's largest bird breeding colonies &ndash; and, said Bristol, one of the most important and best-managed such colonies anywhere in the Seychelles archipelago.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith so many sooty terns on an island that covers less than 1 sq km of land, it's easy to imagine that there would be little room for anything else.

Even the island's shape resembles a bird: if you look at a satellite image of Bird Island, it resembles in outline a coquettish dove adrift in the Indian Ocean.

They mainly lived along Hokkaido&rsquo;s warmer southern coast and traded with the Japanese. But after the Meiji Restoration (about 150 years ago), people from mainland Japan started emigrating to Hokkaido as Japan colonised the northernmost island, and discriminatory practices such as the 1899 Hokkaido Former Aborigines Protection Act displaced the Ainu from their traditional lands to the mountainous barren area in the island&rsquo;s centre.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very ugly story,&rdquo; said Professor Kunihiko Yoshida, law professor at Hokkaido University.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForced into agriculture, they were no longer able to fish for salmon in their rivers and hunt deer on their land, Yoshida said.

In reality, the palatial complex's water is sourced from a nearby reservoir, known locally as \"tanks\".

The pools at the top of the rock are filled with rainwater, and a series of drains cut into the rock connect to a large cistern, which feeds into the underground conduit system to help supply the gardens with water. \"The total conception involves the knitting together of a number of hydraulic structures of varied scale and character in a single intricate network &ndash; a complex masterpiece of irrigation engineering design,\" wrote Bandaranayake.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBandaranayake also notes in his essay that during excavation, water conduits were found at different depths, likely to achieve varying water levels; something that required a masterful knowledge of physics and engineering.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the complex's origins date to the 5th Century, the story of how it came to be seems more like a modern-day soap opera.

Longing for the homeland they'd been brutally ripped from, the residents set up their own close-knit community to blend their African traditions with American folkways, raising cattle and farming the land. One of the first towns established and controlled by African Americans in the US, Africatown had its own churches, barbershops, stores (one of which was owned by Patterson's uncle); and the Mobile County Training School, a public school that became the backbone of the community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this once-vibrant neighbourhood fell on hard times when a freeway was constructed in the heart of it in 1991, and industrial pollution meant that many of the remaining residents eventually packed up and left. \"We couldn't even hang out our washing to dry because it would get covered in ash [a product of the oil storage tanks and factories on the outskirts of Africatown],\" said Patterson. With the high-profile closure of the corrugated box factory, International Paper, in 2000, and an ensuing public health lawsuit brought about by residents, Africatown's community that had swelled to 12,000 people in the 1960s plummeted to around 2,000, where it stands today.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20220207-the-last-known-ship-of-the-us-slave-trade-4"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":["p0bl7hbx"],"imageAlignment":"left","imageAltText":"A marker commemorating Cudjoe Kazoola Lewis, one of the Clotilda survivors","imageOrientation":"portrait","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20220207-the-last-known-ship-of-the-us-slave-trade-5"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EThe exodus, poverty and environmental scars were visible as Patterson drove further into Africatown.

Rarely do people talk about their love of the English language this way. &ldquo;I grew up listening to Doric accents because of my parents' love of traditional folk music, which is especially strong here,&rdquo; McKean told me. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what first drew me to the north-east of Scotland &ndash; I wanted to see the places and little villages that I knew so well from the songs I loved.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to shout about your culture, it&rsquo;s helpful to have a plentiful supply of ballads, poems and folk stories.

They hae slain the Earl o&rsquo; Murray, And laid him on the green&rdquo;). But the academic believes there is a wealth of Doric material, even if its value as a language in public life has been devalued.

Over the past few years, increasing attempts to halt or reverse the decline of indigenous languages have been made, from First Nations societies in Canada to Saami communities in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. As a result, oral culture is being increasingly safeguarded and becoming more accessible in ways never possible before.

But gradually, Doric fell out of use as many places experienced Anglicisation and strong industrial growth, particularly during the oil boom of the 1970s.

It is frequently used to describe equinoctial gales, which can feel relentless this far north when the seasons change in spring and autumn.

Our departure had already been delayed by the gales for many hours and for a time the forecast said that no flying would be possible for several days. Instead, however, half-an-hours' notice was given to scramble to the airport and make a narrow weather window.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp align=\"left\"\u003EIn a year dominated by domestic travel, Foula has perhaps been the most extreme option available to Brits. Sometimes referred to as Ultima Thule &ndash; Latin bywords for extremely remote destinations &ndash; it is said to be the most remote inhabited British island, reached by an unpredictable ferry or the frequently hectic 17-minute flight from the Shetland Mainland.

By that point in early October, the island's ferry hadn't sailed for a couple of weeks and wasn't expected to try again for several more. This meant that the 30 or so permanent residents on the island depended wholly on the vagaries of light aircraft to bring them supplies. \"It could be like this until the next equinox really,\" said Sheila Gear, Foula resident of almost 60 years. \"It's only really late April or May that the wind finally stops.

They may also know that this was the last place in the United Kingdom to speak a Norse language, Norn. However, they may not be aware that the reason the language finally died out was because of a pandemic &ndash; not Covid-19, but smallpox, lethal waves of which washed over the island in the 18th Century, killing the majority of residents.

One night I saw a dead rabbit on the side of Foula's only significant road; by morning, great skuas had disassembled it to something unrecognisable. The smaller Arctic skua (skooty aalin) is hardly a shrinking violet itself, but even it loses chicks to the bonxies.

The majority of the settlement is on the east side of the island, sheltering from the most violent of the North Atlantic's furies. Disparate farms are surrounded by peat moss bogs that are dutifully patrolled by mismatching Foula sheep and Shetland ponies.
